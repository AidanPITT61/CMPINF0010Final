    "This code reads and organizes the arrest dataset. It identifies the top 15 neighborhoods with the highest number of arrests by counting how often each neighborhood is mentioned. It also identifies the 15 neighborhoods with the lowest number of arrests. After collecting the data, the program organizes it into a readable list that shows each neighborhood’s arrest count and rank. This information provides an estimate of the overall safety of Pittsburgh neighborhoods. The input and output parameters can also be adjusted to display more than 15 results, such as the top 20, 30, or 50 neighborhoods."

    "In conclusion, the data suggests that smaller neighborhoods and those located farther from the city tend to have fewer crimes and arrests, while neighborhoods closer to downtown Pittsburgh experience higher arrest rates. This pattern may also be influenced by population differences, as neighborhoods with fewer residents naturally record fewer arrests. Therefore, the data indicates that proximity to the city and population size are correlated with arrest frequency, which means the closer and more populated a neighborhood is, the higher the number of arrests is likely to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the moderately populated neighborhoods, Regent Square and Central Northside stands out as two of the best options. They maintain a relatively low number of arrests while still being only 15–20 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh(RS) and ~5 minutes for the Central Northside, offering the advantages of city living without the higher crime rates seen in more central areas. To further determine which neighborhood is truly the best overall, it would be necessary to compare population density and calculate the median arrest rate for each neighborhood. But in comparison with the access of transportation and history of property sales, Regent Square* would be the best to maintain an affordable home, have access to public transportation, and low crime rates."
