    "The code below analyzes property sales for the year 2025. Since the year has not yet been completed, the code only collects what it can from the data, covering the period from the beginning of the year to now (January-November). It analyzes two different ranks, which are the top 15 school districts with the most property sales and the top 15 school districts that recorded the fewest sales this year so far. This code provides a list for each rank and displays the number of sales in each school district. If needed, this code can also be adjusted to list a different amount than 15. "

    "In conclusion, the analysis of the property sale data set (Jan-Nov) provided the information that the most property sales active School District was the Pittsburgh School District, which has 5939 property sales this year (Jan-Nov). The least showed Penn-Trafford School District, which has only 1 property sale this year (Jan-Nov). These show the high volume vs low volume markets, for example, low volume school districts like Penn-Trafford, which include low volume neighborhoods like Trafford, Penn Township, Harrison City, and Manor, struggle to attract buyers to their area, which shows weakness in the community and may not be the place someone would want to settle down. While high-volume school districts like Pittsburgh have high-volume neighborhoods like Squirrel Hill, Shadyside, and Regent Square. Regent Square also stands out here just because it ranks high with other data sets, which implies that this would be a nice neighborhood to settle down in."
