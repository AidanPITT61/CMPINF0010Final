    "This code identifies the top 20 most frequently used bus routes. It analyzes the routes with the highest average ridership, ranks them from most to least used, and outputs each route number along with its rank and average number of riders. By examining these top 20 routes, we can determine which neighborhoods they serve and evaluate the accessibility of their stops, providing insight into how public transportation serves the different neighborhoods of the city."

    "In conclusion, the data shows that the most frequently used bus lines run through the City of Pittsburgh, with the highest average ridership concentrated on the eastern side of the city. This region benefits from greater access to multiple routes, making it one of the most connected areas for public transportation. Many of the busiest lines, such as the 61 and 71 routes, run through this part of the city. This provides residents along these routes with convenient access to amenities such as shops, schools, and community services that may not be as readily available in other parts of the city.The eastern side of Pittsburgh is also home to several major universities, including the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, and Chatham University, as well as a variety of shops, restaurants, and community spaces. This combination of accessibility, educational opportunity, and local amenities makes the area the best for residents seeking both convenience and connectivity. Finally, When narrowing the focus to specific neighborhoods within this region, Regent Square* stands out as one of the best examples—offering affordable living, strong transportation links through the 61 routes, and close proximity to the city’s academic and cultural centers."
