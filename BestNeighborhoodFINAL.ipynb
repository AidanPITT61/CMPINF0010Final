    "# CMPINF0010 - BEST NEIGHBORHOOD IN PITTSBURGH\n",

    "After looking through the data sets provided on WPRDC, we decided to go with these 3 sets:\n",
    "- Property Sales\n",
    "- Access to Public Transportation\n",
    "- Arrests Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we decided to go with Property Sales because it helped to narrow down areas to see which neghiborhood are most desirable. This gave us a better look at which neighborhoods has the fastest & most sales. Secondly, we used a data set that demonstrated the most used buslines within/around Pittsburgh. We used this data set because we believe Public Transportaiton is important for everyone, due it to allowing cheap and effective transportation around the city. It's also can people an important factor to ceartin people to be close to ceartin bus lines depending on their job, school, convience, or etc. The last data set we used was Arrests rate and used this because safety is always a big concern to people when they move. This data set demonstrated which neighborhoods had the highest arrest and which neighborhoods had the lowest. Using the arrest data, we could determind which neighborhoods might have high crime and which ones would have the least. Lastly, due to the difference in populations sizes between the different neighborhoods, we decided to use a list of the Top 15 highest and lowest for each data set. This helped us to figure out to find out which neighborhood showed up most fequently, along with who had the best results or match among the most frequent.\n",

    "## Access to Public Transportation\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Data from the 'Monthly Average Ridership by Route & Weekday' data set, we're able to draw a relation of which bus lines are most commonly used and readily avaliable. This helps us to figure out the best neighborhood by showing which lines are the highest used and which are the lowest used. It also allows us to look at line on maps and figure out which neighborhood it serves along with what convinences or amenities it has. With this, we're able to find the most used lines tend to be on the eastern side of the city. This helps us to narrow down our neighborhoods to the east along with showing the most used lines on that side were the P1-3 , 61A-D, 71A-D. These lines also provided access to some of the best amenties and services such as PITT, CMU, Downtown, resutrants, stores, and etc. Neighborhoods along these lines also had some of the highest property sales/values, which demonstrated these lines we're some of the most sought after. Due to this, we determinded our best neighborhood should have easy and close access to these lines, which would allow them for easy transportation for the best amentites along with anywhere else they migh need to go. \n",

    "\n",
    "For this we decided to examine which 15 neighborhoods had the least amount of crime. But due to the differences in population in neighborhoods, we decided to ignore any neighborhood that we felt had little to no population as it would be unfair to bigger neigborhoods. After apply this filter, we got the results of 15 neighborhoods and looked if they we're close or along the lines we determinded we're best for access to public transportation. This worked out better than expect, as most results we're actually located close to these lines futher narrowing the search of the best neighborhood.\n",

    "First, we imported all of the data sets.\n",

    "Then we broke them down into their own groups, which allows to focus on one for now and come back later once we have the data needed. "
